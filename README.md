## Technologies Used

## Description

_This is a landing page for Tyler's programming portfolio. It contains a brief introduction to who he is. Coding experience, education and a few hobbies._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _This page runs with a standard index.html and styles.css file_
* _With the exception of a few Bootstrap CSS selectors/proporties._

_Within the HTML I placed the dominant CSS link after the Bootstrap link, so there shouldn't be any CSS code conflicts_

## Known Bugs

* _On window resize there is a period when the images are not resized proportionally. This could be tweaked in the media queries I sure._
