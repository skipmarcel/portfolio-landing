            <p><h4><strong>Hello, I'm Tyler Adams</strong></h4> I'm based in Portland Oregon. I'm currently making a drastic career change. I've been tattooing for over <span style="font-weight:bold;">25 years!</span>. You can find my tattoo page on instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sailing_sv_tattoo/" target="_blank">here</a>. My new path is in the realm of tech. In 2022 I began studying coding. In 2023 I started attending <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/" target="_blank">Epicodus</a> A school for tech careers. So far its been very exciting!

            <p><h4><strong>I'm drawn to the tech world</strong></h4>because it represents not only a huge challenge but also an oppertunity to constantly learn in an ever changing arena. Before approaching coding with Epicodus I have only dabled in WYSIWYG style editors such as Squarespace, Wordpress and Flash.  
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">These are some of my current objectives:</span></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Become comfortable with HTML and CSS</li>
              <li>Learn the ins and outs of Bootstrap</li>
              <li>Become more proficient with GIT</li>
              <li>Learn <strong>JavaScript</strong></li>

            <p><h4><strong>In 2011 I opened my tattoo shop</strong></h4> <a href="https://www.grizzlytattoo.com/" target="_blank">Grizzly Tattoo</a></p>
              <p>The last 12 years have taught me a lot about business, managing people and how important it is to stay relevant with in a competative industry. I've also learned that your body has limits. Tattooing for years has taken its toll on my back and neck. I'm ready for a more sustainable career as I get older. I'm also very excited at the prospect of remote work. I would love to work from any port I might find myself in.

            <p><h4><strong>Sailing is very important to me</strong></h4> My stepfather had a Hobie Cat. He would take my mother and I sailing in Mission Bay. Although the sailing bug didn't really take hold until I was an adult living on Catalina Island working as a maintenance man at <a href="https://catalinaislandcamps.com/?utm_source=local&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gmb" target="_blank">Catalina Island Camps</a> A friend had bought a trimaran that I helped bring back to life. We sailed that boat in some of the most beautiful water San Diego has to offer. I was hooked from then on. I now have my own monohull here in the Pacific NW and cruise the San Juan Islands as often as I can.

           <p><h4><strong>Surfing = Good mental health</strong></h4>I started surfing when I was in junior high school in San Diego. I've kept it up as much as I can. Living in the NW surfing is a much colder and rugged sport in comparison to the waters of San Diego.
